Info about each project submitted:

- I did all coding for BigInteger, MazeGen, and uwnickd-powerpaint.

- In TowerDefense I was responsible for all of the model (AStarA;gprotj, AStarTile, AStarTileComparator, Board, Controller, Enemy, House, RunMain, Terrain, Tile, and Tower). 

My friend Jared did most of the view (Gamepanel, GUI, HotKeyController, InfoPanel, and MouseController).

- For WordCompress, and Compress I did all coding except for the main in each which was used for testing by my proffesor. 

- Each project is pretty clearly commented, but I thought adding this might make it even more clear.
