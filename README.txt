Info about each project submitted:

- I did all coding for BigInteger, MazeGen, uwnickd-powerpaint, and all files included in Nicks Python Weather Project.

- In TowerDefense I was responsible for all of the model (AStarAlgorithm, AStarTile, AStarTileComparator, Board, Controller, Enemy, House, RunMain, Terrain, Tile, and Tower), and most of the GUI now. My friend Jared started and did some of the basis of the GUI in 2012, but I have picked it up from there and added a considerable amount to it. This is an ongoing project. I am making a tower defense game similar to a custom game in WC3 called Wintermaul Wars. 



- For WordCompress, and Compress I did all coding except for the main in each which was used for testing by my professor. 

- DataCacheSimulator is a project that was done in Computer Architecture. It takes in an address trace and moves instruction and data reads/writes from memory through the CPU cache. This project simulates a dual core CPU. Visual GUI was done by Jon Sobocinski, and I did the rest.

- Each project is pretty clearly commented, but I thought adding this might make it even more clear.
